#### INSTALLATION

There are a few different ways to install our framework, our most recommended way is via our installer. 

###### DOWNLOADING THE INSTALLER

First, download the framework installer by clicking [here](https://github.com/XENONMC-DEV/XFRAME-INSTALLER/archive/main.zip)
Next, extract the installer to your webserver to where you want the framework to be installed, we recommend installing it to the root of the site.

###### RUNNING THE INSTALLER

To run the installer, just navigate to the install file from the web address of your website, 
for example, lets say you installed it to a folder named `MyProject`, then you would navigate to it via a url similar to this:
  `https://example-domain.com/MyProject/install.php`.
  
Once done, the installer will ask to start the installation following some other confirmation info, if everything looks correct, you may start the installation.
Lastly, when the installer prompts you saying the install is complete you may close the page, and thats it, you successfully installed XFRAME!
